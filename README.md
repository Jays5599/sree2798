## Hello World ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sreedhar and I build data pipelines for a living! Currently, I am looking for an opportunity as a data engineer.

I graduated from University of Texas at Dallas with a master's degree in business analytics, where I worked on some cool Generative AI and data engineering projects!


- ðŸ’¼ Hands-on experience with data migration projects between cloud data warehousing platforms (Databricks & Snowflake).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently figuring out the mystics of distributed computing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving Apache Spark and Cloud data warehousing.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about challenges in a real time data migration project, I would love to speak about my experience.
- ðŸ˜ƒ I'm excited about how GenAI can transform data engineering landscape. check my mini project [here](https://github.com/sree2798/Talk-to-a-database-using-GenAI)
